# Ginger-Tumeric-Refractor

1. I originally noticed there were a lot of <div> and it felt a little overwhelming so i changed up some of the properties like the class header for header attributes.
2. updated <div class="content"> for main element 
3. added a main semantic under <div class="hero">  ####fix
4. updated divs for the section element.
5. used the aside element for the side content.
6. noticed there was no class in css for the class, benefits so i deleted that line.
7. changed the fonts from h3 to h2 and back to h3.
8. updated the <div class="footer"> to just the <footer> element
9. updated the color in css for the side content to #0072bb
10. added text-alight: center; to aside property in css.
