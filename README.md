# Ginger-Tumeric-Refractor
##The purpose of the repo was to refactor this code base and make some improvements to it.
###1. I originally noticed there were a lot of divs and it felt a little overwhelming so i changed up some of the properties like the class header for header attributes.
###2. updated Content class for main element 
###3. added a main semantic under the Hero Class
###4. updated divs for the section element.
###5. used the aside element for the side content.
###6. noticed there was no class in css for the class, benefits so i deleted that line.
###7. changed the fonts from h3 to h2 and back to h3.
###8. updated the Footer Class to just the footer element
###9. updated the color in css for the side content to #0072bb
###10. added text-alight: center; to aside property in css. 
###11. consolidated matching properties and values in css, there was quite a few. 
###12. changed paragraph sizes a little bigger.
